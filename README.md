# Libraqries and Tools
* [Module] `Spring Boot`
* [Module] `Spring Integration`
* [Library for auto-generating getters, setters, constructors and others] `Lombok`
* [Tool for sending HTTP requests] `Postman`

# How it works
It is just a maven Spring Boot application which you can build and run it like any other Spring Boot application.
After running it, you should a `GET` http request to url http://localhost:8080/welcome/NAME with 
`Content-Type:application/json` as the Header variable.
